🧠 StyloScope: FashionMNIST Classification with Deep Learning
📌 Overview
StyloScope is a neural network-based image classifier trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. It recognizes clothing items like shirts, sneakers, and bags from grayscale images. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, it demonstrates fundamental deep learning techniques like image preprocessing, one-hot encoding, and feedforward neural network training.

🧑‍💻 Objective
To build a fully functional deep learning model that can classify fashion items from image data—focusing on data handling, model architecture, and training performance using Python and TensorFlow.
